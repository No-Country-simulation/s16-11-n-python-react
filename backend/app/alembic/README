## Creating migrations

```bash
alembic revision -m "some descriptive message here"
```

A new file will be created inside `alembic/versions`. Upgrading and downgrading logic must be defined manually.

## Running migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade "revision_id"
```

The "revision_id" will be in the specific `alembic/versions/revision_id` file.

```bash
alembic upgrade ae1
```

It is possible to use a partial number instead of the full id.

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Alternatively, we can simply use `head` to use the latest revision.

```bash
alembic upgrade +2
```

Or specify a number of migrations to apply.

## Get current migrations

```bash
alembic current
```

```bash
alembic history
```

## Downgrading migrations

```bash
alembic downgrade "revision_id"
```

We can use the same arguments as `running migrations`.

```bash
alembic downgrade base
```

Or `base` to downgrade to the start.
